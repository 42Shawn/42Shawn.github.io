## BIO
I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) under the supervision of Prof. [Yan Yan](https://tomyan555.github.io/). In the meantime, I am a visiting student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison under the supervision of Prof. [Yong Jae Lee](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~yongjaelee/).        

<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">[I'm on the 24/25 academic job market. Feel free to contact me.]</span>    

My research focuses on **Efficient and Scalable AI Systems**, with specific emphasis on 
- **Neural Network Compression**: [LONDON](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12905) (ICCV'2021), [CMIM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02970) (ECCV'2022), [LCR-BNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06540) (ECCV'2022),[Causal-DFQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.136820) (ICCV'2023), [CL-Calib](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Shang_Enhancing_Post-training_Quantization_Calibration_through_Contrastive_Learning_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf) (CVPR'2024)
- **Visual Generative Model Acceleration**: [PTQ4DM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15736) (CVPR'2023), [QuEST](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03666), [PTQ4DiT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16005) (NeurIPS'2024), [DKDM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03550).
- **Efficient (Visual, Language, and Multimodal) Large Models**: [Bi-MTDP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14136) (CVPR'2024), [RPTQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01089), [ASVD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05821), [LLM-Viewer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16363) (Efficient LLM Survey), [LLaVA-PruMerge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15388), [INTP-Video-LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12963). 
- **Fast Optimization for Neural Networks**: [MIM4DD](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/24d36eee157559e0d2549455fba28f6a-Abstract-Conference.html) (NeurIPS'2023), [DQAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07268) (ECCV'2024), [LTDD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14506).    

I was a Research Scientist (Intern) at Google DeepMind supervised by Daniele Moro and Andrew Howard, working on training inference-efficient large language models. Additionally, I interned as a Research Scientist at Cisco Research supervised by Gaowen Liu and Ramana Kompella, where I developed efficient computer vision models and created the model slimming toolbox for Cisco.    

Before Ph.D., I worked as research assistants at Shandong University and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) under the supervision of Prof. [Liqiang Nie](https://liqiangnie.github.io/index.html) and Prof. [Dan Xu](https://www.danxurgb.net/), respectively. 
I received my bachelor's degrees in Applied Mathematics and Economics (dual degrees), advised by Prof. [Xiliang Lv](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SIJCkXcAAAAJ&hl=en) at Wuhan University.     

I regularly serve as PC member, and reviewer for multiple international conferences and journals such as CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, ACM-MM, WSDM, NeuroComputing, Information Sciences, CVIU, TMM, TCSVT, and TKDE.    


_Besides research, I am a contract photographer for Shutterstock Images and Getty Images, and here is my [portfolio](https://500px.com/p/yuzhangshang)._
