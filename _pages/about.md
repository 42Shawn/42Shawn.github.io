## BIO
I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student of Computer Science at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) under the supervision of Prof. [Yan Yan](https://tomyan555.github.io/) and a co-op research scientist at Cisco Research. My research focuses on **_Efficient/Scalable AI_**, particularly for **Generative Models** and **Large Language Models**. My goal is **MAFA (Make AI Fast Again)**. I am from [Dongying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongying), Shandong Province, China.    

Before IIT, I received my bachelor's degrees in Applied Mathematics and Economics (dual degrees), advised by Prof. [Xiliang Lv](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SIJCkXcAAAAJ&hl=en) at Wuhan University. I worked as research assistants at Shandong University and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) under the supervision of Prof. [Liqiang Nie](https://liqiangnie.github.io/index.html) and Prof. [Dan Xu](https://www.danxurgb.net/), respectively. Special thanks to Prof. [Nie](https://liqiangnie.github.io/index.html), who continues to co-mentor me during my Ph.D. pursuit journey.     

I regularly serve as PC member, and reviewer for multiple international conferences and journals such as CVPR, ICCV, ICML, NeurIPS, WSDM, NeuroComputing, Information Sciences, CVIU, TMM, TCSVT, and TKDE.    


_Besides research, I am a contract photographer for Shutterstock Images and Getty Images, and here is my [portfolio](https://500px.com.cn/shang)._
