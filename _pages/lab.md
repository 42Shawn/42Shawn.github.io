## Welcome to Scalable Learning Lab (sLearn-Lab) at UCF.    
Welcome to our research lab at the University of Central Florida (UCF), part of the Department of Computer Science and the AI Initiative. Our mission is to build the next generation of **efficient and scalable machine intelligence**. We hope to achieve this through a fundamental approach, co-designing and optimizing AI algorithms and hardware systems. Our work can result in low-cost, high-performance frameworks. We hope it can be applied to accelerate scientific discovery.
